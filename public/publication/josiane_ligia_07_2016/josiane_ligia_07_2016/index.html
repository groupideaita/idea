  <meta name="description" content="Brazilian aeronautics industry has been supported by national economic policies, most of them linked a Defense Programs. In the eighties, military acquisition programs supported the AM-X (A-1), a ground attack aircraft. In the nineties, military acquisition programs supported the AL-X (A-29), a turboprop aircraft designed for light attack and advanced training. More recently (2009), it was created the KC-390 Acquisition Program that supported the project and development of a cargo military aircraft that is expected to improve technological capabilities of the national aircraft industry, while providing military defense capability. Late industrializing countries, like Brazil, design defense public programs for developing aerospace industry. EMBRAER, the leader of Brazilian aeronautics industry, plays an important role in this context as a key firm that stimulates other small and medium-sized national firms. The building and strengthening of industrial national technological capabilities, through the Defense Acquisition Programs, need to be evaluated. Preferably, such evaluation should take into account the impacts at the firm level. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the most relevant academic approaches for evaluating public programs. Most of economic approaches of research and development (R&amp;D) evaluation focus on the discrete products of research. If one is interested in the capability created by R&amp;D or in its transformational impacts, then cost-benefit or rate of return approaches provide only limited insights. They rarely take into consideration the mutability of the products evaluated, much less the changes in people and institutions. Product-oriented and output-focused evaluations tend to give a short shrift to the generation of capability in science and technology, and to the ability to produce sustained knowledge and innovations. In the context of evaluating the impacts of the Brazilian Defense programs, there is a scarcity of aggregated and non-aggregated public data. It seems necessary to use a descriptive model that could capture these impacts in terms of the development of technological capabilities in basic, intermediary, and advanced levels. So, the descriptive stage model of accumulation of technological capabilities was reviewed. It was argued that this model provides a framework that is useful for analyzing and evaluating impacts of Brazilian Defense Programs designed for developing aeronautics industry." />

    <h3>Resumo</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Brazilian aeronautics industry has been supported by national economic policies, most of them linked a Defense Programs. In the eighties, military acquisition programs supported the AM-X (A-1), a ground attack aircraft. In the nineties, military acquisition programs supported the AL-X (A-29), a turboprop aircraft designed for light attack and advanced training. More recently (2009), it was created the KC-390 Acquisition Program that supported the project and development of a cargo military aircraft that is expected to improve technological capabilities of the national aircraft industry, while providing military defense capability. Late industrializing countries, like Brazil, design defense public programs for developing aerospace industry. EMBRAER, the leader of Brazilian aeronautics industry, plays an important role in this context as a key firm that stimulates other small and medium-sized national firms. The building and strengthening of industrial national technological capabilities, through the Defense Acquisition Programs, need to be evaluated. Preferably, such evaluation should take into account the impacts at the firm level. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the most relevant academic approaches for evaluating public programs. Most of economic approaches of research and development (R&amp;D) evaluation focus on the discrete products of research. If one is interested in the capability created by R&amp;D or in its transformational impacts, then cost-benefit or rate of return approaches provide only limited insights. They rarely take into consideration the mutability of the products evaluated, much less the changes in people and institutions. Product-oriented and output-focused evaluations tend to give a short shrift to the generation of capability in science and technology, and to the ability to produce sustained knowledge and innovations. In the context of evaluating the impacts of the Brazilian Defense programs, there is a scarcity of aggregated and non-aggregated public data. It seems necessary to use a descriptive model that could capture these impacts in terms of the development of technological capabilities in basic, intermediary, and advanced levels. So, the descriptive stage model of accumulation of technological capabilities was reviewed. It was argued that this model provides a framework that is useful for analyzing and evaluating impacts of Brazilian Defense Programs designed for developing aeronautics industry.</p>
